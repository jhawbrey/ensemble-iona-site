A New Orleans area native, soprano MELANIE RUSSELL enjoys performing both as
a soloist and collaborative artist in professional choral music and chamber ensembles. Noted for her “steely sparkle and almost impossibly fast, clean runs” (The Wall Street Journal) as well as “a really nice voice” (anonymous 5th grader), she has performed and recorded regularly with premier ensembles in the U.S., including the Grammy-nominated Choir of Trinity Wall Street, Seraphic Fire, TENET, and Clarion, as well as with Grammy-winners Conspirare and the Rolling Stones. An enthusiast of staged works and new music, she was thrilled to be part of the world tour of Philip Glass’ and Robert Wilson’s
Einstein on the Beach for several years. A few notable performance highlights include Ellen Reid’s prism at the Kennedy Center (postponed due to Covid-19), Du Yun’s Angel’s Bone, Webern’s virtuosic Opus 18 for soprano, clarinet, and guitar as part of Trinity Wall Street’s Webern Festival, and a cabaret at the
Metropolitan Room with singer/ songwriter Kate Bass. She is a graduate of Yale University, Loyola University New Orleans, and Centenary College of Louisiana. She currently resides in Covington, LA where she very much enjoys spending time with a variety of feathered and furry pets.
