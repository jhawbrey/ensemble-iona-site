Born into a musical family, MICHAEL JONES is a GRAMMY® award-winning
international soloist, chamber musician and clinician. Noted as singing “particularly beautifully” (Chestnut Hill Local), Michael has appeared as a soloist with the Philadelphia Orchestra, Tessarae Baroque, Choral Arts Philadelphia, Academy of Sacred Drama, Haverford University Choir and Orchestra, Disney’s All-American College Band and Peoria Area Civic Chorale, among several others. Michael has sung at the Finnish National Opera House, Lincoln Center’s Merkin Hall, Los Angeles’ Disney Hall, and Philadelphia’s Verizon Hall at the Kimmel Center, to name a few.

In addition to his extensive solo career, Michael also regularly performs with some of the nation's finest choral ensembles. Most notably, Michael sings with two GRAMMY® award winning groups, The Crossing and Conspirare. Michael has sung with Santa Fe Desert Chorale before but is truly excited to be in Santa Fe for the summer festival celebrating 40 years!

On top of his vocal career, Michael also plays trumpet all over the world in multiple settings; from New Orleans style brass band to chamber orchestra to small group jazz. You name it: Michael has done it. In the fall of
2019, Michael played with the critically acclaimed Youngblood Brass Band, dubbed by Dazed and Confused as "hip-hop's heaviest brass section," for their European fall tour.

While living in Chicago, he played a weekly gig at The Green Mill, one of Chicago's legendary jazz clubs. He is an original member of J-Livi and the Party, The Cincy Brass, Cincinnati's award-winning brass band and
played with Four Star Brass Band.

Now working his way into the Los Angeles scene, he occasionally plays with a band named Dustbowl Revival. Outside of singing and playing, Michael enjoys running, tacos, west coast IPA's, barbershop tags, and a Rittenhouse Rye Old Fashioned.
