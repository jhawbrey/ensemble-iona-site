Praised for possessing “a voice of surprising power and emotion” (TheaterJones), and “great dignity and a gorgeous mezzo, finely finished and expressive” (Dallas Morning News), lyric mezzo soprano Erin Roth Thomas regularly performs as a featured soloist with some of the finest ensembles in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, singing a vast repertoire that spans from early to 20th century music.

In addition to singing with Ensemble Iona, Erin has enjoyed performances with American Baroque Opera Company, Orpheus Chamber Singers, Orchestra of New Spain, and Plano Symphony Orchestra, among others.

Equally comfortable on the opera stage, Erin has performed numerous roles, including Acis in *Acis y Galatea*, Pitti-Sing in *The Mikado*, Prince Orlofsky in *Die Fledermaus*, and The Mother in *Amahl and the Night Visitors*. She is looking forward to the upcoming season, where she is engaged as a resident artist with Portland Opera.

From Lufkin, Texas, and a proud graduate of Stephen F. Austin State University, Erin lives in the Dallas area with her husband, Chad.
