Praised for possessing “a voice of surprising power and emotion” (TheaterJones),
and “great dignity and a gorgeous mezzo, finely finished and expressive” (Dallas Morning News), lyric mezzo soprano ERIN ROTH THOMAS regularly performs as a featured soloist with some of the finest ensembles in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, singing a vast repertoire that spans from early to 20th century music.

Equally comfortable on the opera stage, Erin has performed numerous roles, in-
cluding Acis in Acis y Galatea, Pitti-Sing in The Mikado, Prince Orlofsky in Die Fledermaus, and The Mother in Amahl and the Night Visitors. Erin also provides worship music for many DFW area churches and currently serves as a staff singer at Christ Church Plano.

Erin is looking forward to the upcoming season, where she will enjoy engagements with American Baroque Opera Company, Texarkana Regional Chorale, Orpheus Chamber Singers, Orchestra of New Spain, and Incarnatus, among others.

From Lufkin, Texas, and a proud graduate of Stephen F. Austin State University, Erin lives in Plano with her husband, Chad, and the best dog in the world, Reggie.
